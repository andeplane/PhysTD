Asteroid defense game play summary
 - You have a planet to defend againt the constant threat of asteroid belts
 - Resources are gained by destroying asteroids, which will your people will mine
 - Resource types: Diamond, gold, silver, ++
 - Defense tech is gained by science research
 - An asteroid lose some of its energy when it comes within the atmosphere, which is why they eventually will collide
 - Health points is population, people die when planet is hit
 - Population increases over time. This increases how fast local mining happens

Attack mechanisms:
 - Meteors
 - Asteroids
 - Comets
 - Alien space ships


Defense mechanisms:
 - Three main types
    - Laser turrets on rotating planet
     - Fast and accurate
     - 
    - Orbiting defense rockets
     - Can have all types of orbits.
     - Close orbit is fast, but less time close to asteroid
     - Distant orbit stays longer in same place, but swipes less area
     - Elliptic orbits is a combination
    - Moons
     -  they will take the hit, but you won't get resources without special mining ships)
     -  they change orbit of asteroids due to gravitational pull 
    - Special upgrades
     - nuclear (various radius and strength)
     - relativity boost (slows time for asteroids)
     - Mirrors / portals
    - Atmosphere
     - People on the planet can create an atmosphere that will act like friction
    - Magnetic fields 

 - Weapons:
   - Lasers (keywords: vaporize, X MW, project, flux, heat, hunter, )
    - 
   - Nuclear
    - 
   - 

GFX:
 - Comets have particles behind them
 - Explosion when comets/asteroids collide with planet
 - 

Levels:
Level 1 (intro / tutorial)
 - There are no defense mechanisms. Population starts at 10
 - The asteroids will just hit the earth, reducing the population to 5
 - Before level 2, you can research
