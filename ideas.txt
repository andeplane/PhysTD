ChatGPT prompts:
 - what are potential defense mechanisms against an asteroid colliding with the earth
There are several potential defense mechanisms that could be used to mitigate the impact of an asteroid colliding with the Earth. These include:
 Deflection: This involves changing the asteroid's orbit so that it misses the Earth. This could be done by using a spacecraft to collide with the asteroid and alter its course, or by using a gravitational tractor to slowly change its trajectory over time.
 Explosion: Another option is to explode the asteroid before it reaches the Earth. This could be done using nuclear weapons, but the risks associated with this approach would need to be carefully considered.
 Evacuation: In some cases, it may be possible to evacuate the area where the asteroid is expected to impact. This would involve moving people and critical infrastructure out of the path of the asteroid.
 Shielding: Another option is to use some type of shield to deflect or absorb the energy of the impact. This could include using a space-based shield or deploying a network of satellites to intercept the asteroid.

Attention Earthlings: A massive meteor is hurtling towards our planet and is expected to make impact in the next 24 hours. Scientists and astronomers are closely monitoring the trajectory of the meteor and have determined that it is on a collision course with the Earth. The size and speed of the meteor make it a potential threat to life and property, and authorities are urging everyone to take necessary precautions. Emergency response teams are being mobilized and evacuation plans are being put in place for those living in the predicted impact zone. Stay tuned for updates and follow any instructions from local authorities to ensure your safety.


It's worth noting that these approaches would need to be carefully planned and implemented in order to be effective.

Asteroid defense game play summary
 - You have a planet to defend againt the constant threat of asteroid belts
 - Resources are gained by destroying asteroids, which will your people will mine
 - Resource types: Diamond, gold, silver, ++
 - Defense tech is gained by science research
 - An asteroid lose some of its energy when it comes within the atmosphere, which is why they eventually will collide
 - Health points is population, people die when planet is hit
 - Population increases over time. This increases how fast local mining happens

Attack mechanisms:
 - Meteors
 - Asteroids
 - Comets
 - Alien space ships


Defense mechanisms:
 - Three main types
    - Laser turrets on rotating planet
     - Fast and accurate
     - 
    - Orbiting defense rockets
     - Can have all types of orbits.
     - Close orbit is fast, but less time close to asteroid
     - Distant orbit stays longer in same place, but swipes less area
     - Elliptic orbits is a combination
    - Moons
     -  they will take the hit, but you won't get resources without special mining ships)
     -  they change orbit of asteroids due to gravitational pull 
    - Special upgrades
     - nuclear (various radius and strength)
     - relativity boost (slows time for asteroids)
     - Mirrors / portals
    - Atmosphere
     - People on the planet can create an atmosphere that will act like friction
    - Magnetic fields 

 - Weapons:
   - Lasers (keywords: vaporize, X MW, project, flux, heat, hunter, )
    - 
   - Nuclear
    - 
   - 

GFX:
 - Comets have particles behind them
 - Explosion when comets/asteroids collide with planet
 - 

Levels:
Level 1 (intro / tutorial)
 - There are no defense mechanisms. Population starts at 10
 - The asteroids will just hit the earth, reducing the population to 5
 - Before level 2, you can research 

What is a wave?
 - A well defined (statistical) set of objects going towards the planet
 - A wave has a duration (until the next wave)
 - Each level i has N_i waves
